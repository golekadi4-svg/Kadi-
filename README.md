    <h1>To my gorgeous 😘</h1>
    <p>Happy Monthiversary, my love! Can you believe it’s already been a whole month of us driving each other absolutely crazy with love? Every single moment with you has been magical—from your smile that melts me instantly to the way your laugh makes my heart do somersaults.</p>
    <p>I can’t stop thinking about how lucky I am to have you in my life… you’re not just my girlfriend, you’re my best friend, my partner-in-crime, and my favorite distraction. I love how we can be silly together, serious together, and yet every second feels like it’s just us in the world.</p>
    <p>I can’t wait to hold you close again, steal kisses when you least expect it, and make every day even hotter and sweeter than the last. You make me feel so alive, baby, and I fall for you harder every single day.</p>
    <p>So here’s to us, to our love, and to every naughty, sweet, and unforgettable moment we’re going to make together. Happy Monthiversary, my queen 👑… Oh and I’m only getting started 😏❤️.</p>
